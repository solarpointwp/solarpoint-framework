## Get Support From The Community

For general support questions, specific "how-to" advice, or best practices, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/solarpointwp/solarpoint-framework/discussions/categories/q-a).

**Before you ask:**

- **Search the docs:** Check the [README](README.md) and project documentation.
- **Search past discussions:** Many common questions have already been answered in [Q&A](https://github.com/solarpointwp/solarpoint-framework/discussions/categories/q-a).

If you don't find an answer, feel free to start a new discussion.

### Asking Quality Questions

Taking the time to frame your question well helps everyone. Before asking, consider the following:

- **Search first.** Your question may already have an answer in an existing issue or discussion.
- **Define the problem clearly.** What are you trying to achieve? What is happening instead?
- **Show what you have tried.** Include the steps you have already taken to solve the problem.
- **Provide context.** Share relevant code snippets, error messages (as text, not screenshots), and your environment details (PHP version, WordPress version, etc.).

A well-framed question saves time for everyone and is more likely to receive a helpful response.


## Bug Reports

Your reports help make SolarPoint better for everyone. Please provide as much detail as possible to help us investigate and resolve the issue efficiently.

**Before submitting:**

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/solarpointwp/solarpoint-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen) and [closed issues](https://github.com/solarpointwp/solarpoint-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed) to check if your bug has already been reported or resolved.
- Test for theme and plugin conflicts: deactivate all other plugins and switch to a default WordPress theme. Confirm the bug still occurs.
- Note if this is a regression (something that previously worked but has stopped working in a newer version).

**When submitting:**

- Provide a clear and concise description of the bug.
- Describe what you expected to happen and what actually happened instead.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue with code samples that follow [SSCCE principles](http://sscce.org/).
- Include your environment details: SolarPoint framework version, WordPress version, PHP version, OS, and database information.
- Provide any error logs, stack traces, or screenshots that may help us diagnose the issue.

**Note:** Reports that do not contain enough information to reproduce the issue may be closed without further action.

## Feature Requests

Your ideas help shape the future of SolarPoint. Please provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and evaluate your request.

**Before submitting:**

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/solarpointwp/solarpoint-framework/issues) and [closed issues](https://github.com/solarpointwp/solarpoint-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed) to check if it has already been proposed or implemented.
- If a similar request exists, use a reaction to show your support rather than opening a duplicate.
- **If you plan to implement this feature yourself**, please start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/solarpointwp/solarpoint-framework/discussions/categories/ideas) first to confirm it aligns with the project's direction before investing time writing code.

**When submitting:**

- Provide a clear and concise description of the feature.
- Explain the problem or use case this feature would solve and why it's needed.
- Include any proposed solution or implementation ideas.
- Add examples, references, or additional context that might help us evaluate your request.
